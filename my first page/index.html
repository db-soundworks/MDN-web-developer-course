    <h1>MDN Web Developer Course: My First Page</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph of my page. It has meaningless content that is used <strong>just to create stuff to play with.</strong>
    Just entered a paragraph return in the <em>HTML</em>.</p>

    <p>Above is a photo of a bug, which came from <a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/free-photos" target="_blank">this site.</a> 
    The site features <em>"High quality photography with worry-free licensing for personal and commercial use."</em> 
    It looks like the sight may come in useful for finding images for projects in the future.</p>
    <p>Here is the second paragraph. Not much to say here, just some fodder to fill the page in with more contet.
      Exploring adding more paragraph returns in the HTML (one after this text) 
      to see if there is a return or not (there is a space after the parenthesis followed by a newline).
    </p>
    <p>So, as demonstrated above, adding paragraph returns in the HTML file <strong>has no effect</strong>
      so paragraphs of text can be written in the file so they wrap and are easy to read
      with no impact on the browser rendering of the page.
